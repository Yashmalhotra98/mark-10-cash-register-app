# mark-10-cash-register-app
A Cash Register app that lets you know the cash we receive after payment in terms of the no. of Notes. This app made using vanilla Js, HTMl, CSS. 
We take only 2 inputs as follows:
1. Bill Amount 
2.Cash given,
after that it calculates the remaining amount to be returned to the customer in minimum no. of notes.

This app is in Dark theme for all the vampires out there like myself.
